'''
The most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments. This creates a function that
can be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to allow. For example:
'''



def ask_ok(prompt, retries=4, reminder='Please try again!'):
    while True:
        ok = input(prompt)
        if ok in ('y', 'ye', 'yes'):
            return True
        if ok in ('n', 'no', 'nop', 'nope'):
            return False
        retries = retries - 1
        if retries < 0:
            raise ValueError('invalid user response')
        print(reminder)

'''
An easier example for you to really get the meaning of what happened above is this:
'''

def greet(name):
    while True:
        print(" hello " + name)
        return
greet('xylofon')

print(greet)

You can also try out most of the codes and change them to your
desired words in order to fully understand what the code does, and how it works.
