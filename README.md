# My lists, you can simply try out each code and see how it works, and probably play with it to see how it works.

fruits = ['guava', 'pineapple', 'oranges']
people = ['jack', 'john', 'micheal']
print(fruits)
print(people)
print(">>> i made changes to both my lists, see below")
fruits.append("cashew")
